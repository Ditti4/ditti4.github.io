Today marks the day I plan to move forward, and move on from WordPress. The last few years I've been a loyal WordPress user, mostly for the lack of a better and easy alternative. Recently, however, I've been looking into static site generators and I discovered [Jekyll][jekyll].

After spending some time figuring out how everything works and how to adjust the theme ([Hydeout][hydeout] if anybody is wondering), this is what I ended up with.

Over the next few days, I will try to move over whatever I deem important and everything else will vanish. This is more than just switching from one software to another. This is saying good bye to an era.

WordPress, thank you for everything. You've been amazing, but I have to move on.
