Hi! I'm Rico Dittrich (Ditti for short), a German software engineer passionate about all things programming (well, almost all of them anyway) and anything revolving around it. When I'm not busy using a keyboard, I travel the world with open eyes and an open mind.

I'm bad with introductions, so I will simply let my blog and social media speak for me. If you have any questions, you can contact me there.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is using the [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/) theme.

## Kammloipe

As part of a university project, I had the opportunity to develop the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kammloipe.app) for the [Kammloipe](http://www.kammloipe.com). During this proejct, I had the chance to get to know different technologies like [jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) and [Android Annotations](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations).
