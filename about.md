Hi! I'm Rico Dittrich (Ditti for short), a German software engineer passionate about all things programming (well, almost all of them anyway) and anything revolving around it. When I'm not busy using a keyboard, I travel the world with open eyes and an open mind.

I'm bad with introductions, so I will simply let my blog and social media speak for me. If you have any questions, you can contact me there.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] and is using the [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/) theme.
